# PULSAR 0.02a

Pulsar is in **VERY** early development at the moment.

The backend is not hosted publicly so the game will not be able to run correctly;
This will change fairly soon.

Feel free to look over the code to see how the game is being developed.

**NOTE:** Pulsar is being developed as a game and an engine. On release you will be able to use it to create your own modern MUD, without the hassle of building many of the underlining systems, and only have to worry about tweeking things and creating content for your game.
